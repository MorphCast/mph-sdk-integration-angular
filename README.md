This template should help get you started developing with **MorphCast SDK** and Angular.

## Getting started

Firstly, [generate a license key](https://www.morphcast.com/sdk-licence-request/) for MorphCast SDK and insert into the configuration snippet. 

You can find the configuration of the MorphCast SDK, under:

* `src/assets/helpers/ai-sdk/loader.js` 

The **start()** / **stop()** controls of the MorphCast SDK are inside the app.component.ts:  

* `src/app/app.component.ts`

All the ready-to-use components binded to the specific modules of the MorphCast SDK are under:

* `src/app/`

You can find the latest [documentation of the MorphCast SDK, here](https://ai-sdk.morphcast.com/latest/index.html).

# Angular instructions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
